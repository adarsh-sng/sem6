            - Reduced time
            - Accessibility
            - Automatic updates
            - Scalability
        - **Advantages of PaaS:**
            - Simple and convenient
            - Cost effective
            - Efficiently managing the lifecycle

        - **Advantages of IaaS:**
            - Cost effective
            - Website hosting
            - Security
            - Maintenance. -> *no need to mangage the underlying data center or worry about deployment of new releases*
- **Difference between IAAS, PAAS and SAAS:**
    | Basis    | IaaS | PaaS | SaaS |
    |----------|------|------|------|
    | Uses    |  used by network architects    |  platform as a service    |  by end users    |
    | Access  |  resources like virtual machine and storage    |    gives access to run time env to deployment and development tools for application  |    gives access to end user  |
    |Model  |   service model provides visualization   |   cloud computing tools   |      |
    | Examples |    AWS Virtual provide cloud   |     Microsoft Azure |    IBM cloud Analysis  |

        - Less Customaizability 
        ---
    - Private: internal or corporate cloud.
        provides computing services to private internal network

        *Disadvantages*
        - Networking issues
        - Infrastructure Compatibility
        - Reliability
        ---
    - Community: it is a cloud infra that allows systems and services to be accesible by a group of several organizations to share the information.
        *Advantages*
        - Cost effective. -- whole cloud is shared beetween several orgs o rcommunity
        - Security.  -- more secure than public but less than private 
        - Scalability - 
        - Flexibility
        - Sharing 
        *Disadvantages*
        - Limited control
        - Complexity
